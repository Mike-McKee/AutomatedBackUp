# Purpose of this Folder
I started working on this code locally, without version control. I thought about creating a github repo, but my initial goal was to get a feel for programming again. I foolishly managed versions of my code my creating multiple "Version#" files. Luckily, I came to my sense now and have an actual repo.

Anyway, this is the orginal code from this project. Pre-Repo, at least.
